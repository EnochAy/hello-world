This is my first public repository
Enoch Ayomide Fadeyi is a graduate of Mathematics and Education from the University of Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria.
I am a certified data scientist with R programming language for data science. 
I am also interested in Python programming language as well, currently learning data science with Python. 
I have concluded my first data science project using R and I am looking forward to sharing it soon on this platform.
